# gBOT
gBot, make your roblox group, ready to start

# How this bot works?
This bot is programed in discord.js, roblox.js and node.js. We use .ROBLOXSECURITY to enter the account and make what **YOU** say to the bot do.

# Roblox.js
Roblox-js is a node module that provides an interface for ROBLOX site actions, mostly for use with their HttpService feature.

Most functions are related to group service but there are other general functions as well. The list of main functions is in the contents section, they all have detailed documentation.

To use this with HttpService simply set up API's on your node server for accessing the functions, you can use the example server outlined in the below example server section as a base. Note that this does not use the latest version of the module and it is recommended you learn how to use the library directly.

# Discord.js
discord.js is a powerful node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API very easily. It takes a much more object-oriented approach than most other JS Discord libraries, making your bot's code significantly tidier and easier to comprehend.

Usability, consistency, and performance are key focuses of discord.js, and it also has nearly 100% coverage of the Discord API. It receives new Discord features shortly after they arrive in the API.

# Node.js
Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems, there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop. Typically, behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script, and at the end a server is started through a blocking call like EventMachine::run(). In Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node.js exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like browser JavaScript â€” the event loop is hidden from the user.

HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.
